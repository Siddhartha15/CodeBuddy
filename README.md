# CodeBuddy
A weekly activity, where usually a junior and a senior get paired up. Pairs change every week, and each week there are 2 problems (generally DSA based, interview type questions) assigned, and each pair has to discuss the problem among themselves, and come up with a solution. After this the junior codes out the solution, and the senior validates it.
